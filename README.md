During the next 4 weeks we will be exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of InfoSec. Get ready ffor a challenging month of all about seccurity.

## GNU/Linux
We will be using GNU/Linux as our base operating systems, there is no such thing as working in security and using Windows, it does not work and also it does not look cool!
Information Security professional use any flavor of Unix/Linux. It is OK if you use Mac, we know that nobody is perfect!
So, go ahead and download and install (virtualize) either Ubuntu or Kali. You can actually can use any other variant.
We will be using mainly the command line, no GUI!

## Projects
We will work on some weekly projects and this projects will be implemented in Python!
