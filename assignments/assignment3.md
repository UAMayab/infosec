# Assignment #3

## Problem 1
Instead of an online bank, suppose t h a t Alice provides an online chess playing service known as Alice's Online Chess (AOC). Players, who pay a monthly fee, log into AOC where they are matched with another player of comparable ability.

- Where (and why) is confidentiality important for AOC and its customers?
- Why is integrity necessary?
- Why is availability an important concern?
- Where should cryptography be used in AOC?
- Where should access control used?


## Problem #2
When you want to authenticate yourself to your computer, most likely you type in your username and password. The username is considered public knowledge, so it is the password that authenticates you. Your password is something you know. 

- It is also possible to authenticate based on something you are, that is, a physical characteristic. Such a characteristic is known as a biometrie. Give an example of biometric-based authentication.
- It is also possible to authenticate based on something you have, that is, something in your possession. Give an example of authentication based on something you have.
- Two-factor authentication requires that two of the three authentication methods (something you know, something you have, something you are) be used. Give an example from everyday life where two-factor authentication is used. Which two of the three are used?
