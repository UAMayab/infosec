# Assignment #1
In this assignment you will be implenting in Python code a Caesar's cipher and performing cryptoanalisis on a corpus of text that will be provided.
You will be given a set of ciphertext and your goal is to get the cleartext either by brute forcing it and/or doing cryptoanalysis.
Your app should present a menu or have command line parameters to select the task to perform.

Available tasks: 

- encrypt/decrypt using the Caesar Cipher.
- perform cryptoanalisis on the ciphertext using as a reference the three available corpus of data
- plot your statistical analysis from the corpus of data

Happy hacking!
