# Assignment #2
For this second assignment, you will use ChatGPT as a computer security tutor to learn to use the tools "openssl".
First, start by reading the manual page for this command from the command line.
Now that you have a basic idea, prompt ChatGPT to provide you an overview of the openssl application/command.

Your goal is to:

- encrypt the provided cleartext file using symetric key crypto with salt. Record your key since I will use it to decrypt back your ciphertext, and also submit the command you run at the comand line.
- decrypt the provided ciphertext with a key I will share here. More clues in the Keys section next, third bullet point!
- generate your own personal certificate (self-signed)
- explain how this tool relates to the CIA Triad


## Keys:
- Private Key: tutifruti
- I will give you my own certificate
- To open your eyes you need a 256 view, it helps to shop at the AES stores even when the cbc is salted!

## Deliverables:
- a ciphertext with your key to decrypt it and, the corresponding command you used.
- the cleartext from the provided ciphertext
- your own certificate
- Create a presentation about the tool (7-10 min) with an special focus in the commands you run and a DETAILED explanation of all options.
- provide your lucky number
- provide the public link for your ChatGPT session where you show all your prompts and responses.
