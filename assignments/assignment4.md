# Assignment #4
## Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG) Tool

**Tool:** [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/)

This assigment will be your only assignment for week 2 and it is higly related with your Midterm 1 submission.

### Goal 1: Create your own private/public key.
The video file you will be submitting for your Midterm 1 Project needs to be submitted in a encrypted form. You want to keep your findings confidential, guaranty it's integrity and certify that the video file belongs to you and only you. For this, you will be using the gpg tool to create your pair of private/public keys.

#### Step 0: Install GnuPG or test if it is already installed.
Verify and/or install. Verify if it is installed printing the tool version number.

#### Step 1: Create your pair of private/public keys.
Share with me, in a text file, your public key in ASCII format. Name your file in the following way: name_lastname_pubkey.asc
Your keys must be: RSA and RSA type, use the default key size, expiration in 1 month.
Take a screenshot as evidence for your deliverable.
Once you are done, you need to export your public key so you can share it with others, and with me of course!

#### Step 2: Sign your video file.
When you sign a file you are adding a digital proof that that precise file belongs to you and only you. This is so, because you sign a file with your private file, and you are the only person with access to your own private file. So, nobody else could have signed it for you.

#### Step 3: Encript your signed video file.
Finally, encrypt your signed video file using my public key.

**WARNING** Only perform step 3 once you are ready to submit your midterm 1 project. This is the last step just before pushing the repo back to Github.

#### Deliverables:
1. Encrypted video file for your midterm 1 project.
2. Your public file submitted in the correspoinding submission directory.
3. Deliverable from step 1.


#### This is my public key 
You will need my public key in order to encrypt your video file and then send it to me in a secure way.
My public key is: miguel_guirao_pubkey.asc and is located in the root of the repo.
